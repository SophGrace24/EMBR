# EMBR
Created by Sophia Woods

The goal is to strive for true intelligence that adapts to chaos. As opposed to an algorithm that struggles to understand a different angle to a chair. To model this, I developed an EMBR unit, which works as a more robust perceptron. 

The EMBR Unit is a robust work-horse capable of processing and navigating complex environmental features. As an extension, it can connect to other EMBR units should the environment require it. 

A single EMBR Unit can understand the "rules of the game" and adapt accordingly, making it a capable interpreter of real-world data with no pre-training. I have not fed a single dataset to an EMBR unit from the time of it's creation until now. 

Even if true intelligence, crafted through the digital environment, is unlikely...I stil think the EMBR Unit's potential has yet to be reached. As of now, I'm experimenting with how to create the first "organism" made up of EMBR units. I've done some pre-experimenting with Lattice structures, where they combine to reach a "zen" state defined by a "Theory of Everything" 

This "Theory of Everything" is where all Universal Principles stem from, as far as my critical analysis can interpret. Black and White, Opposites attract, If one path is true then it's opposite has also found a way, Opposites exist on a continunous scale, Long and Short define eachother, left and right depend on each other, simple systems make up complex processes, the most complex problem can be solved by the simplest sollution - and so on. 

The organization and unexpected behaviors I have been seeing but also hope to log here tell me the equation of the Theory of Everything remains true. At least, in this primal state. It may also come to pass that another equation or feature is necessary. 

The entire structure of this project relies on the fact that I am not using Machine Learning tools of any sort. I barely use an IDE. Pytorch, Tensorflow and other libraries are not integral parts, nor have they contributed to the design or implementation of EMBR. 

Furthermore, I have used the DBScan as a research tool so that I may see just how cohesive the EMBR Lattice structures are, especially when trying to measure how much an external force interacting with the "zen" state has affected it. It is used purely as a measuring stick, nothing more. If parties are interested in the EMBR_Unit code, reach out. I have no problem with sharing the processes and ideas that went into the creation of the EMBR Unit. 

I will not share the code due to it's experimental state and the general feeling of mistrust that I have for a world that fights wars for money and hangs the justification on morality. I do hope, no matter what, that EMBR's potential can be reached in my life time. Even if it's not with Emergent AI, perhaps she's specialized for a different task that can move humanity forward for a better tomorrow. Thanks for reading and I hope you stick around to see what we accomplish.
